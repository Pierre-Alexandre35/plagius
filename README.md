## Requirements
plagiarism detector must work on code written in 2 languages of your
choice
- e.g., Python, JavaScript, HTML, Rust, Racket, …
- Java is not allowed
• you need to design an tool for detecting similarities between two programs
- should go beyond textual “diff” (e.g., consider renaming variables,
extracting code into functions, moving code, changing comments, etc.)
- should handle multi-file programs (assume files may have been
renamed)
• interactive user-interface
- choice of desktop application or web-based system
the main “logic” for your application must be written in Java
- UI may be web-based, using HTML/CSS/JavaScript
• you may use existing libraries for basic infrastructure
- parsing code, building ASTs, …
- but not for the main logic that identifies similarities
• follow the development process as presented in the lectures
- testing, documentation, version control, continuous integration, …
• recommended: study the literature on plagiarism detection
