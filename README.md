## Description
Northeastern University <a href="https://pages.github.ccs.neu.edu/CS5500-CourseMaterials/2019-Fall-Section1/index.html">Sofware Engineering</a> class project. Plagius is a code plagiarism application that detects code similitary between two filles (JavaScrip or TypeScript). 


## Requirements
- Plagiarism detector must work on code written in 2 languages of your choice. e.g., Python, JavaScript, HTML, Rust, Racket. Java is not allowed
- You need to design an tool for detecting similarities between two programs
  - Should go beyond textual “diff” (e.g., consider renaming variables, extracting code into functions, moving code, changing comments, etc.)
  - Should handle multi-file programs (assume files may have been renamed)
- Interactive user-interface
  - Choice of desktop application or web-based system
  - The main “logic” for your application must be written in Java
  - UI may be web-based, using HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- You may use existing libraries for basic infrastructure
  - Parsing code, building ASTs
  - But not for the main logic that identifies similarities
- Follow the development process as presented in the lectures
  - Testing, documentation, version control, continuous integration
- Recommended: study the literature on plagiarism detection
